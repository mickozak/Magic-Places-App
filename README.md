*The application is available only via the link. The application has demo data. The application is fully functional - the user can create an account. The GIT repository has a preview function, do not install extensions because the application has deliberately deleted files containing sensitive data.

**In the application you can not add photos via upload because Heroku in the free version does not support collecting files.
